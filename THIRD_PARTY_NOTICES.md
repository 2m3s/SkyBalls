## Firmament storage overlay

SkyBalls's storage overlay (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.features.misc.storage` package and the SkyBallsCustomGuiScreenMixin, SkyBallsCustomGuiContainerMixin, SkyBallsSlotCoordsMixin and SkyBallsScreenChangeMixin mixins) is ported from Firmament:

- https://github.com/FirmamentMC/Firmament (branch mc-26.1)
- Copyright Linnea Gräf <nea@nea.moe> and Firmament Contributors
- Relevant source: src/main/kotlin/features/inventory/storageoverlay/, src/main/kotlin/util/customgui/, src/main/java/moe/nea/firmament/mixins/customgui/ and mixins/ScreenChangeEventPatch.java
- Code license: GNU General Public License v3.0 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later). Because of this, SkyBalls as a whole is distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE).
- Assets: the storage overlay sprites under assets/skyballs/textures/gui/sprites/storageoverlay/ are Firmament's, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0), by Linnea Gräf and Firmament Contributors.

Each ported source file keeps a Firmament attribution and SPDX header. The Kotlin code was rewritten in Java; Firmament's MoulConfig search field and button are vanilla widgets here, and its storage data is saved in config/skyballs/storage-overlay.json.

## NopoMod emoji assets

SkyBalls's integrated chat-emoji renderer uses the emoji sprite set and emoji-name data from NopoMod.

Upstream project: https://github.com/NopoTheGamer/NopoMod
Pinned source commit: 3243c18910c1b281f6585cd4657b349df4c60d50

The Gradle build fetches those upstream assets into the generated resource directory rather than copying the binary sprites into this repository. The upstream project's LICENSE applies to those assets/source materials.

The SkyBalls feature implementation itself is a separate Java implementation and does not copy NopoMod's Kotlin feature architecture.

The pet display's overflow-level calculation from the tab list (adding the XP of the capped levels to the "+N XP" overflow line and recomputing the level on the legendary curve, and the progress line format) follows NopoMod's `features/pets/PetDisplay.kt` and `OverflowPetLevels.kt`, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1.

## Skyblocker

SkyBalls's /sj custom item and armor customization (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.custom` package and its mixins) is ported from Skyblocker:

- https://github.com/SkyblockerMod/Skyblocker
- Version: v6.10.4+26.2
- Relevant source: src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/skyblock/item/custom/, the GUI utilities it uses under src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/utils/, and the DataComponentHolder, DyedItemColor, ItemStack and EquipmentLayerRenderer mixins
- Assets: the customization screen sprites under assets/skyballs/textures/gui/ and the related en_us translations

Skyblocker is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0).

Each ported source file keeps a Skyblocker attribution line. SkyBalls replaces Skyblocker's config, NEU repository and scheduler dependencies with its own small implementations.

SkyBalls's Item Price Tooltip follows Skyblocker's AvgBinTooltip, LBinTooltip and NpcPriceTooltip (src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/skyblock/item/tooltip/adders/) and reads auction prices from the same API (hysky.de). The container menu mixin that notifies slot listeners (used by the Chronomatron solver) follows Skyblocker's AbstractContainerMenuMixin.

Mouse Lock (`SkyBallsMouseLock`) follows Skyblocker's garden mouse lock (src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/skyblock/garden/LowerSensitivity.java): its farming tool list (FarmingHudWidget.FARMING_TOOLS) and the barn area where the lock pauses.

## CommandKeys

SkyBalls's /sj keys GUI and macro system is a port of TerminalMC/CommandKeys (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.commandkeys` package, its mixins, the `skyballs_commandkeys` assets and translations, and the MultiLineEditBox entry in `skyballs.classtweaker`).

- https://github.com/TerminalMC/CommandKeys
- Branch: mc26.2
- License: Apache License 2.0 (a copy is included at assets/skyballs_commandkeys/LICENSE.txt)

Changes made for SkyBalls: repackaged, mod ID changed to `skyballs_commandkeys`, the command moved to /sj keys, the multi-platform service loader replaced with a Fabric implementation, and a one-time import of SkyBalls's previous command key macros added. Each modified source file keeps its original license header with a note of these changes.

SkyBalls's rarity item backgrounds, calendar date calculator and commission HUD style are ported from Skyblocker (see above).

## Skyblocker dungeon and experimentation features

SkyBalls's dungeon map, puzzle solvers, secret waypoints, room detection, terminal and device solvers, and experimentation table solvers (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.sb` package and the `assets/skyballs/dungeons` room data) are ported from Skyblocker v6.10.4+26.2 (LGPL-3.0), keeping Skyblocker's source structure. Skyblocker's config, location, scheduler and rendering classes are replaced by small SkyBalls stand-ins, and its custom world renderer is replaced by one built on Minecraft's gizmos.

## SkyHanni repository data

Several SkyBalls features use chat and item patterns, slayer XP and spawn costs, and the sea creature list published in SkyHanni's data repository (https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni-REPO, MIT License). The sea creature list is downloaded at runtime; the patterns and slayer values are included in SkyBalls's source.

## SkyHanni GUI Position Editor

SkyBalls's /sj gui position editor is an adaptation of the SkyHanni GUI position editor interaction model, including draggable HUD boxes, hover information, keyboard movement, and scroll-wheel scaling.

- https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni
- Relevant source: src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/config/core/config/gui/GuiPositionEditor.kt and src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/data/GuiEditManager.kt
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1)

SkyBalls's implementation is independently adapted to SkyBalls's own Java/Fabric 26.x HUD system and does not add SkyHanni as a runtime dependency.

## SkyHanni Current Chat Display

SkyBalls's current chat display (`SkyBallsCurrentChat.java`) follows SkyHanni's CurrentChatDisplay (src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/features/chat/CurrentChatDisplay.kt): the channel-change message patterns and the channel names and colours. SkyHanni is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1).

## SkyOcean

SkyBalls's search-keybind and recipe-command workflows are adapted from the corresponding SkyOcean features:

- https://github.com/meowdding/SkyOcean
- Item search: src/main/kotlin/me/owdding/skyocean/features/item/search/ItemSearch.kt
- Recipe command: src/main/kotlin/me/owdding/skyocean/commands/CraftHelperCommand.kt
- Recipe autocomplete: src/main/kotlin/me/owdding/skyocean/utils/suggestions/RecipeNameSuggestionProvider.kt

SkyBalls's /sb search (SkyBallsStorageSearchScreen and the island chest, museum and highlight code in SkyBallsStorageSearch) is a Java port of SkyOcean's item search: features/item/search/screen/ItemSearchScreen.kt, SearchCategory.kt and SortModes.kt, features/item/search/matcher/ItemMatcher.kt, features/item/search/search/ReferenceItemFilter.kt, features/item/search/highlight/ItemHighlighter.kt, features/misc/ChestTracker.kt, data/profile/IslandChestStorage.kt and features/item/sources/. Its museum reading follows SkyblockAPI's MuseumAPI (https://github.com/SkyblockAPI/SkyblockAPI, src/main/kotlin/tech/thatgravyboat/skyblockapi/api/profile/items/museum/MuseumAPI.kt, MIT License, Copyright (c) ThatGravyBoat). SkyOcean's Olympus UI widgets are drawn with vanilla GUI calls.

SkyBalls's /sj recipe craft helper is a Java port of SkyOcean's craft helper (src/main/kotlin/me/owdding/skyocean/features/recipe/crafthelper/ and commands/CraftHelperCommand.kt): the recipe tree with leftover carry-over, the have/need evaluation, and the tree display. SkyOcean's code is licensed under the MIT License (SkyOcean License v1, section 1); SkyBalls reads recipes from the NEU repository instead of SkyOcean's repo library.

## Stella

SkyBalls's dungeon secret routes (`features/dungeons/DungeonRoutes.java`) follow Stella's secret-route system: the route file format (steps of waypoints and a path line), the waypoint types and labels, the room coordinate scheme (the blue terracotta roof corner as the origin, with the corner that holds it giving the rotation), step advancing on secret pickup, and automatic recording.

- https://github.com/Eclipse-5214/stella
- Relevant source: src/main/kotlin/co/stellarskys/stella/features/secrets/SecretRoutes.kt, features/secrets/utils/routes/ (RouteRegistry.kt, RoutePlayer.kt, RouteRecorder.kt, WaypointType.kt) and api/dungeons/map/Room.kt
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

Stella's default routes ("generated by Stella, recorded by Luckkytigger") are not bundled with SkyBalls. They are downloaded at runtime from Stella's route server (https://ether.stellarskys.co/routes/default.json) and cached in the SkyBalls config folder.

## Odin

Several SkyBalls dungeon features follow Odin's implementations:

- https://github.com/odtheking/Odin (main branch, Minecraft 26.1.2)
- Relevant source: `utils/skyblock/SplitsManager.kt`, `features/impl/skyblock/Splits.kt`, `utils/PersonalBest.kt`, `features/impl/dungeon/InvincibilityTimer.kt`, `LeapMenu.kt`, `BloodCamp.kt` (including its Watcher and blood mob head textures, mob skull data by DocilElm), `DoorHighlight.kt`, `PositionalMessages.kt`, the puzzle solvers in `puzzlesolvers/` (Ice Fill, Boulder, Creeper Beams, Three Weirdos, Quiz, Teleport Maze, Water Board and Blaze) with their data files `ice-fill-floors.json`, `boulder-solutions.json`, `creeper-beams-solutions.json`, `quiz-answers.json` and `water-solutions.json` (copied to `assets/skyballs/puzzles/`), and `render/PlayerSize.kt`

Ported to Java in `features/dungeons/DungeonFeatures.java` (splits, split PBs, mask timers), `LeapMenu.java`, `BloodCamp.java`, `BloodCampSkulls.java`, `DoorHighlight.java`, `PositionalMessages.java`, `OdinPuzzleSolvers.java`, `OdinTerminals.java` (terminal solvers from `features/impl/boss/TerminalSolver.kt` and `utils/skyblock/dungeon/terminals/`), `OdinDevices.java` (`SimonSays.kt`, `ArrowAlign.kt`, `ArrowsDevice.kt`), `mixin/SkyBallsPlayerSizeMixin.java` and `mixin/SkyBallsToggleSprintMixin.java` (`AutoSprint.kt` / `LocalPlayerMixin.java`). Each file names Odin in its class comment.

## NoammAddons

SkyBalls's dungeon map ("NoammAddons (Legit)" style) and dungeon score calculator are ported from NoammAddons:

- https://github.com/Noamm9/NoammAddons (26.2 branch)
- Relevant source: `features/impl/dungeon/map/MapRenderer.kt`, `MapConfig.kt`, `utils/dungeons/map/handlers/HotbarMapColorParser.kt`, `MapUpdater.kt`, `ScoreCalculation.kt`, `utils/dungeons/map/utils/MapUtils.kt`, `utils/dungeons/map/core/`, `features/impl/dungeon/ScoreCalculator.kt`, and the checkmark and marker textures in `textures/gui/dungeonmap/` (copied to `assets/skyballs/textures/gui/dungeonmap/`)

Ported to Java in `features/dungeons/NoammMap.java` and `features/dungeons/ScoreCalculator.java`. NoammAddons is dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal.

## Skysoft Held Item

SkyBalls's Held Item (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.features.helditem` package and the SkyBallsHeldItemMixin, SkyBallsSwingSpeedMixin, SkyBallsHeldItemTextureMixin and SkyBallsHeldItemMiningMixin mixins) is a Java port of Skysoft's Held Item feature (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, commit 79259743734d614a75f9d64bb8fa54163bfcfc1d): src/main/kotlin/com/skysoft/features/helditem/, config/HeldItemConfig.kt, the Held Item Update Fix from config/FixesConfig.kt, the ItemInHandRenderer, ItemModelResolver, LivingEntity swing and MultiPlayerGameMode mixins, and the pixel controls it draws with (utils/gui/PixelButtonRenderer.kt, PixelControlRenderer.kt, OverlayPanelStyle.kt, TextElision.kt, utils/SnapshotHistory.kt).

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

## Skysoft Tooltip Scroll

SkyBalls's tooltip scroll (`features/misc/ScrollableTooltips.java`, `SkyBallsTooltipMixin`, `SkyBallsTooltipScrollMixin`) is a Java port of Skysoft's Tooltip Scroll (src/main/kotlin/com/skysoft/gui/tooltip/TooltipViewport.kt and TooltipPanSession.kt, com/skysoft/config/TooltipScrollConfig.kt, and the tooltip positioner / mouse scroll mixins): the pan session with smooth movement, the keyboard and mouse wheel controls, and the settings.
